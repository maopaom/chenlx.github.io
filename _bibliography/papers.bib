  abstract={Longitudinal fetal brain atlas is a powerful tool for understanding and characterizing the complex process of fetus brain development. Existing fetus brain atlases are typically constructed by averaged brain images on discrete time points independently over time. Due to the differences in onto-genetic trends among samples at different time points, the resulting atlases suffer from temporal inconsistency, which may lead to estimating error of the brain developmental characteristic parameters along the timeline. To this end, we proposed a multi-stage deep-learning framework to tackle the time inconsistency issue as a 4D (3D brain volume + 1D age) image data denoising task. Using implicit neural representation, we construct a continuous and noise-free longitudinal fetus brain atlas as a function of the 4D spatial-temporal coordinate. Experimental results on two public fetal brain atlases (CRL and FBA-Chinese atlases) show that the proposed method can significantly improve the atlas temporal consistency while maintaining good fetus brain structure representation. In addition, the continuous longitudinal fetus brain atlases can also be extensively applied to generate finer 4D atlases in both spatial and temporal resolution.},

  title={ASSURED: A Self-supervised Deep Decoder Network for Fetus Brain MRI Reconstruction},
  author={Wu, Jiangjie and Chen, Lixuan and Li, Zhenghao and Wang, Rongpin and Wei, Hongjiang and Zhang, Yuyao},
  abstract={High-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volume reconstruction from multiple arbitrary orientation motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for fetal brain MRI studies. Currently, most existing methods follow two-step approaches that iteratively perform slice to volume registration (SVR) and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR). However, the 3D volume reconstruction is often corrupted due to slice misalignment and brain anatomy blurring caused by severe motion during MR data collection, making the quantification challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel learning-based self-supervised volume reconstruction technique that is robust to slice misalignment and motion artifacts. Specially, we combine a comprehensive forward model to present the complex image degradation process and an under-parameterized deep decoder structure to reduce the network overfitting with image artifacts caused by slice misalignment and motion. This methodology requires only one coarse SVR step in the whole reconstruction process and does not need any training dataset in SRR. We evaluated the performance of our technique on simulated MRI from brain atlas and on real clinical scanning fetus MR data. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved superior fetus brain reconstruction results compared with state-of-the-art methods},

  abstract="High-resolution (HR) 3D fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume reconstruction from multiple motion-corrupted stacks of 2D thick slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis. Reliable sliceto-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential for high-quality isotropic volume reconstruction. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing motion correction and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, current supervised DL methods for SVR and SRR require external large-scale training datasets, which are difficult to obtain in clinical fetal MRI settings. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction without using external databases. Specifically, we formulate the SVR process as a function that maps a thick 2D input slice and a target 3D volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. For the SRR process, we utilize a decoding network possessing a deep image prior framework with a comprehensive image degradation model to generate the HR volume. The decoding network, utilizing a forward degradation model, offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes from input slices of individual subjects. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-theart fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.",

  abstract="Longitudinal brain atlases are essential tools for studying brain development.

In this paper, we propose a multi-stage deep-learning framework to address this issue by treating it as a 4D image denoising task, where the 4D data consists of 3D brain volumes and 1D age. Our framework employs implicit neural representation to construct a continuous and noise-free longitudinal brain atlas as a function of the 4D spatial-temporal coordinate. We evaluate our approach on two modalities of brain atlases (QSM and fetus atlases) and show that our method significantly improves temporal consistency while maintaining accurate representation of brain structures. Furthermore, the continuous functions generated by our method can be used to generate 4D atlases with higher spatial and temporal resolution.",
